Description: dlib is a C++ library by Davis E. King that contains (amongst many other
             things) fast and freely licensed image processing and machine learning
             functionality. This package is a wrapper around that library that allows
             R programmers to consistently and conveniently incorporate dllib into
             their work, in a similar fashion to the 'BH' package's inclusion of
             the Boost library.
